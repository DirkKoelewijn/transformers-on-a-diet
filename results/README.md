# Results

In this folder, you will find the results of experiments:

* In `results/raw`, result files of individiual CSV files will be added if experiments are executed as in the `examples` folder. This folder does not show in Git as it has no contents. If you want to use it, add it yourself.
* In `results/combined` you can find the combined results of all experiments (`all.csv`), the best-performing result per experiment based on the validation accuracy (`all_val_accuracy.csv`) or based on the validation macro-F1 score (`all_val_macro_f1.csv`).
