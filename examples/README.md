In this folder, you can find Jupyter notebooks containing examples on how to parse data, train the model and of course evaluate it:

* In `data.ipynb` you can find how to parse/preprocess the training data.
* In `baseline.ipynb` you can find how to train and evaluate the baseline model.
* In `gan.ipynb` you can find how to train and evaluate the models with a regular GAN.
* In `wgan.ipynb` you can find how to train and evaluate the models with a WGAN.
